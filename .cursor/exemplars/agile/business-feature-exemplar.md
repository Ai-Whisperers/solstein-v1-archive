## Business Context
### Business Problem
System administrators need to extract configuration data from different EBASE environments to analyze, compare, and backup core configuration data for standardization purposes.

### User Need
As a system administrator, I need to extract configuration data in various formats so that I can perform analysis and ensure consistency across environments.

### Business Value
- Enables configuration standardization across environments
- Reduces manual data extraction effort
- Provides foundation for configuration comparison and backup
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

### Success Metrics
- Configuration data can be extracted from all 11 core tables
- Data is exported in multiple formats (Excel, JSON, CSV, SQL)
- Extraction process is automated and reliable
- Performance meets requirements (within 5 minutes for 10,000 records)

## User Stories
### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want to extract bootstrapped configuration data from different EBASE environments in various formats so that I can analyze, compare, and backup core configuration data for standardization purposes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Extract data from all 11 bootstrapped configuration tables
- Export to Excel with proper formatting and metadata
- Export to JSON with nested object structures
- Export to CSV with configurable delimiters
- Export to SQL INSERT/UPDATE scripts
- Support configurable sorting by any column
- Include extraction metadata (timestamp, environment, table structure)
- Handle binary file references (pictograms, icons)

### Secondary User Stories
1. **Data Analysis Story**: As a data analyst, I want to export configuration data in different formats so that I can perform analysis using my preferred tools.

2. **Backup Story**: As a configuration manager, I want to create backups of configuration data in multiple formats so that I can restore environments if needed.

3. **Filtering Story**: As a system administrator, I want to filter and sort extracted data so that I can focus on specific configuration items.

- **Data Analyst**: Secondary user who needs data in specific formats for analysis
- **Configuration Manager**: Secondary user who needs backup and restore capabilities

### User Scenarios
**Scenario 1: Extract All Configuration Data**
- Given I have access to an EBASE environment
- When I run the extraction process for all 11 bootstrapped configuration tables
- Then I receive data in the selected format (Excel, JSON, CSV, SQL)
- And the data includes all records from the specified tables
- And the data includes metadata (timestamp, environment, table structure)

**Scenario 2: Extract Specific Table with Filtering**
- Given I have access to an EBASE environment
- When I run the extraction process for a specific table with filtering criteria
- Then I receive only the filtered data in the selected format
- And the filtering criteria are correctly applied

**Scenario 3: Handle Large Datasets**
- Given I have access to an EBASE environment with large datasets
- When I run the extraction process
- Then the process completes successfully without memory issues
- And progress is reported throughout the extraction
- And the process can be cancelled if needed
