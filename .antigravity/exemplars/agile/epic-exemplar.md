# Epic Exemplar: EPP-192 - Standard Configuration Management

## Epic Header
- **Epic ID**: EPP-192
- **Epic Title**: Standard Configuration NL Power for EBASE System Tables
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-01-15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
Tier 1 BRP customers typically have a split EBASE use for market standard processes and business custom processes. In the current setting they have everything on the same cloud environment. However, they would like to be able to focus more on the processes which they are in control of and outsource most of the standard market message processing and data storage.

As solution the idea is to split EBASE environments in such a way that there is an EBASE SaaS environment which handles all the energy market message data flow and the customer has next to it a smaller size environment in which they can retrieve the relevant market related timeseries but don't have the need for all the message processing functionalities on their side.

### Business Value
- Reduced complexity for customers
- Improved data consistency across environments
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced customer support tickets related to configuration issues

### Success Metrics
- All environments have consistent bootstrapped configurations
- Zero configuration drift between environments
- Reduced customer support tickets related to configuration issues
- Successful data exchange between split environments

### Stakeholders
- **Product Owner**: Ralf Klein Breteler - Business requirements and prioritization
- **Technical Lead**: John Pol - Technical feasibility and architecture
- **Development Team**: Implementation and delivery
- **Customer Representatives**: Validation and feedback

## Scope and Boundaries
### In Scope
- 11 core bootstrapped configuration tables

- Excel-based configuration management
- Multi-format export/import capabilities

### Out of Scope
- Dynamic masterdata synchronization
- Oracle database support
- Existing environment migration
- Real-time data synchronization
- Complex data analysis features

### Dependencies
- **EPP-171**: TS DataStream - Export Timeseries (In Progress)

- **EPP-172**: MD DataStream - Export Masterdata (Backlog)
- **EPP-176**: MD DataStream - Import Masterdata (Backlog)

### Constraints
- Must work with existing EBASE database schema
- Must support MSSQL only
- Must use fixed record numbering ranges (below 1000)
- Must maintain backward compatibility

## High-Level Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Extract configuration data from EBASE environments
- Compare configurations between environments
- Update environments with standard configurations
- Support multiple export/import formats (Excel, JSON, CSV, SQL)
- Provide configuration validation and reporting

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Extract large datasets efficiently (within 5 minutes for 10,000 records)
- **Security**: Secure database connections with proper authentication
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface for both technical and non-technical users
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple environments and concurrent operations

### Acceptance Criteria
- All 11 tables can be extracted and compared
- Configuration differences are clearly identified
- Updates can be applied safely with rollback capability
- Multiple export formats are supported
- Performance requirements are met

## Technical Overview
### Architecture Impact
- New configuration management layer
- Integration with existing EBASE systems
- Support for multiple export/import formats
- Foundation for future data exchange features

### Technology Stack
- **C# with Dapper**: Data access and business logic
- **Excel (EPPlus)**: Primary intermediate format
- **JSON (Newtonsoft.Json)**: Configuration and data exchange
- **MSSQL**: Database operations
- **Windows Forms/WPF**: User interface (Phase 2)

### Integration Points
- **EBASE Database Systems**: Source and target for configuration data
- **File System**: Export/import file storage
- **Logging Systems**: Audit trail and monitoring
- **Configuration Management**: Settings and preferences

### Data Requirements
- Access to 11 bootstrapped configuration tables
- Support for all data types (text, numeric, binary, dates)
- Metadata storage for extraction tracking
- Configuration data for export settings

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks
- **Database Schema Changes**: High Impact - Mitigation: Thorough testing with production-like data
- **Performance Impact**: Medium Impact - Mitigation: Performance optimization for large tables
- **Integration Complexity**: Medium Impact - Mitigation: Phased implementation approach

### Business Risks
- **Customer Adoption**: Medium Impact - Mitigation: User-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation
- **Data Consistency**: High Impact - Mitigation: Robust validation and rollback capabilities
- **Timeline Delays**: Medium Impact - Mitigation: Agile development with regular checkpoints

### Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough testing with production-like data
- Performance optimization for large tables
- Phased implementation approach
- User-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation
- Robust validation and rollback capabilities

## Timeline and Milestones
### Estimated Duration
- **Phase 1**: 8 weeks (Core features - Domain entities, extraction, import, update, comparison)
- **Phase 2**: 6 weeks (Advanced features - REST API, UI, CLI)

### Key Milestones
- **Week 4**: Core extraction functionality complete
- **Week 8**: Complete Phase 1 (all core features)
- **Week 14**: Complete Phase 2 (all advanced features)

### Dependencies
- **EPP-171/175**: May impact timeline if data exchange requirements change
- **Database Access**: Required for development and testing
- **User Feedback**: May require iterations and adjustments
