## User Story
### Main Story
As a system administrator, I want to extract bootstrapped configuration data from different EBASE environments in various formats so that I can analyze, compare, and backup core configuration data for standardization purposes.

### User Type
- **Primary User**: System Administrator
- **Secondary Users**: Data Analyst, Configuration Manager

### Business Value
- Enables configuration standardization across environments
- Reduces manual data extraction effort
- Provides foundation for configuration comparison and backup
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
### Given-When-Then Format
**Scenario 1: Extract all configuration tables**
- Given I have access to an EBASE environment
- When I run the extraction process for all 11 bootstrapped configuration tables
- Then I receive data in the selected format (Excel, JSON, CSV, SQL)
- And the data includes all records from the specified tables
- And the data includes metadata (timestamp, environment, table structure)

**Scenario 2: Extract specific table with filtering**
- Given I have access to an EBASE environment
- When I run the extraction process for a specific table with filtering criteria
- Then I receive only the filtered data in the selected format
- And the filtering criteria are correctly applied

**Scenario 3: Handle large datasets**
- Given I have access to an EBASE environment with large datasets
- When I run the extraction process
- Then the process completes successfully without memory issues
- And progress is reported throughout the extraction
- And the process can be cancelled if needed

**Scenario 4: Export to Excel format**
- Given I have selected Excel as the export format
- When I run the extraction process
- Then I receive a properly formatted Excel file
- And the file includes all data with proper column headers
- And the file includes metadata in a separate worksheet

**Scenario 5: Handle binary file references**
- Given I have tables with binary file references (pictograms, icons)
- When I run the extraction process
- Then the binary file metadata is included in the export
- And the actual binary files are referenced correctly
- And the file paths are preserved for restoration
